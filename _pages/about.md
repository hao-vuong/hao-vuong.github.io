I am a junior undergraduate student at [VinUniversity](https://vinuni.edu.vn/), advised by [Prof. Laurent El Ghaoui](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~elghaoui/) and [Prof. Wray Buntine](https://bayesian-models.org/). I am currently doing research closely with [Boying Li](https://leeby68.github.io/) at [VL4AI Lab](https://vl4ai.erc.monash.edu/index.html) under supervision of [Prof. Hamid Rezatofighi](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/hamid-rezatofighi).

My research interest focuses on achieving lifelong intelligence in robots through dynamic perception and long-horizon planning, which ultimately forms what I consider to be 'natural' intelligence.

My research clusters in 3 areas: (1) learning real-world 4D environments (2) learning to make long-term decisions (3) scaling reasoning and action continuously.

<!-- ongoing research encompass three main thrusts: (1) mastering
real-world visuomotor control via synthetic data, (2) scaling skill-wise towards a general-purpose robot foundation model, and (3) learning to achieve
complex tasks that require foresight. The central theme is leveraging virtual
environments to scale up robot learning. -->

Here are some works that inspire me: [LucidSim](https://lucidsim.github.io/), [Equidiff](https://equidiff.github.io/), [TimeFormer](https://patrickddj.github.io/TimeFormer/), etc..
